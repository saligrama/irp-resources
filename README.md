# IRP Resources

These are resources, including training and test data, optimized result rule lists, and scripts used to analyze the data, for my Honors Biology Independent Research Project "Analyzing Characteristics of 
Poisonous and Edible Mushrooms through Machine Learning."

The optimized rule lists are located in `logs/*/for-*-opt.txt`.
